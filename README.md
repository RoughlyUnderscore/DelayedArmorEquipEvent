This is a slightly modified version of <a href="https://github.com/mfnalex/ArmorEquipEvent">mfnalex's ArmorEquipEvent</a> (which, in turn, is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/Arnuh/ArmorEquipEvent">Arnuh's ArmorEquipEvent</a>), with the only modification being the delay of every `callEvent()` call by a single tick. This way, whenever it is called, the `Player`'s inventory information is factual and matches the expectations. Without the delay, the `Player`'s inventory information is outdated and does not know that the armor contents/inventory contents have been changed.

It is not available on Maven Central or anywhere else. Currently it is only being used by <a href=https://github.com/RoughlyUnderscore/UnderscoreEnchants>UnderscoreEnchants</a> and built locally. To build DelayedArmorEquipEvent, clone this repository and run `mvn install` or `mvn clean install` (don't forget to fork it if you want to introduce some other changes too).
